# Hotel Reservation

**Description:**
This project implements a machine learning solution for Hotels to predict the customer will cancel the reservation or not. The dataset undergoes comprehensive preprocessing, and various classifier algorithms are employed. The models are integrated using a voting algorithm for improved predictive performance.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing steps include Dropping Unless columns, select input and out put an spliting the data.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Multiple classifier algorithms are utilized,  See it in our model 
- A voting algorithm is implemented to combine predictions from individual models.

**Results:**
The project achieves competitive performance, as detailed in the Results section of the README. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are provided.

**Usage:**
Instructions on installing dependencies and running the project can be found in the Installation and Usage sections. Users can easily apply the trained models for predictions using provided examples.
